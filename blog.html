                1. Write the difference between local storage and session storage?
            </h3>
            <h4 class="answer">
                <span>Answer: </span>  &nbsp;<strong> Local Storage</strong> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.<br><br>

                <strong>Session Storage</strong> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.

                1. Write the difference between global scope and block scope?
            </h3>
            <h4 class="answer">
                <span>Answer: </span>  &nbsp;<strong> Global Scope</strong> is the outermost scope in your program. Global scope is already accessible to you when you start writing a new javascript program. Anything you declare in the global scope is available for use throughout the program.

                Variables declared outside functions or code blocks(if, while, for, { }) are in the global scope of the program.<br><br>

                <strong>Block Scope</strong> is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

                1. How does an event loop works in JS?
            </h3>
            <h4 class="answer">
                <span>Answer: </span>  &nbsp;<strong> Event Loop:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.<br><br> The Event Loop monitors the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. When the Call Stack is empty, it will take an event (which is just a callback) from the Callback Queue and push it on to the Call Stack. It is only then that the Call Stack is executes the event.<br><br>
